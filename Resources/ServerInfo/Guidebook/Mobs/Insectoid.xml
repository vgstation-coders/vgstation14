  Chittering creatures from another world, hired on the cheap by your favorite megacorp.

  They can eat cotton, fabrics and clothing, and virtually any food that others would consider edible. They prefer a somewhat higher temperature range than humans.
  Their Insect Blood can't be metabolised from Iron like normal blood.

  Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]50% more Cold damage[/color], [color=#ffa500]10% less Heat damage.[/color], and [color=#7da61a]50% less Poison and Radiation damage[/color]
